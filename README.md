# Snake_Game_2.0

This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Snake game, enhanced with additional features and modern programming techniques. The game includes a snake that grows as it consumes fruits, avoids bombs, and navigates the game board. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including inner classes, anonymous classes, and inheritance, to create a cohesive and modular design.
